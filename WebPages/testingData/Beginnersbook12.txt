When we say high level it means that this language uses common english that can be easily understood by humans. Perl stands for “Practical Extraction and Reporting Language”. Perl is object oriented language that supports all the OOPs features such as inheritance, multiple inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation etc. Use of Perl Perl is a popular programming language used for web applications development. One of the reasons perl is popular in web, is that the perl was initially developed for text processing, which is what we need to do frequently while developing web. There are several things you can do with perl, Perl is commonly used for text processing, CGI(Common Gateway interface) programming, interfacing with databases, developing GUI applications, performing simple and complex system tasks, checking security issues, extracting data & generating reports etc. In short, perl is commonly used for system admin tasks because of its ability to make them easy. Why would I use Perl language? There are several reasons, few of them are as follows: Perl is easy to learn. Perl is portable. Perl program can run on any operating system that has Perl installed. Perl can integrate with most modern databases, work with HTML, XML and other mark-up languages, and has full support for unicode. Perl is a cross platform language. Ability of a programming language (such as Java, Perl) that enables programmers to write a program only once. Cross-platform application can run on most or all systems with little or no modification. Also called multi-platform. Perl is open source that has a large and friendly community, that means that the bugs are fixed quickly. Perl also has a very powerful security feature called “taint”. When taint mode is enabled, Perl monitors every variable that comes from outside of the code. This includes anything read from STDIN(User input) or any other file input as well as all environment variables. What is CPAN? While learning Perl, you would hear this term more often.
